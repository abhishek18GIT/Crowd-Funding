## Why Blockchain ?

Blockchain is a unique, independent and a transparent system which keep the transactions
between parties transparent. Crowdfunding is based on the trust between the investors and
stakeholders.
The emergence of new technologies has great potential in crowdfunding organizations as well
as individuals. Crowdfunding platforms using the blockchain technology increase the
credibility of various projects and ventures and therefore attract huge funds from investors and
donors. 

Limitations of the existing crowdfunding platforms:
1. Exorbitant fees
2. Scam start-ups
3. IP risk
4. DIY marketing
5. Fine print rules and regulations

Benefits of blockchain in crowdfunding:
1. Token system:
While crowdfunding requires enabling the emergence of tangible products, blockchain
usually relies on asset tokenization in order to provide investors with equity or similar
concepts, namely ICO (Initial Coin Offering). In this way, investors would be able to
see the success that is in fact proportional to the subsequent success of the company
itself. This basically means that it has the potential to exploit the various investment
opportunities in the world. Funds being a major aspect for start-ups, this could help
them by saving money on recruitment of their employees by granting them
compensation proportional to the ownership of the business, therefore converting it into
an employee-owned enterprise.
In this case, asset tokens act as currency of their own form, hence allowing the
organisations to hire more professionals, particularly for marketing and advertising.
2. Excess availability:
Any company that uses blockchain technology for crowdfunding would definitely get
funded. Additionally, any individual who has an internet connection will be able to
contribute to such projects. To individuals who invest in crowdfunding using
blockchain technology, it is beneficial in a way that “fraud” will be absent in such cases
because the investors will receive their ownership or a fraction of the enterprise
immediately.
3. Decentralization:
The advantage in this model is that, start-ups are not going to utilize the services of any
platform or platforms in order to raise funds. They no longer have to abide by any rules
or regulations as provided by various platforms. Hence, any project that has the
capability of gaining exposure can get funds and therefore can also omit the requirementof paying the fees to the platforms. Thus, this makes crowd funding cheap and
affordable to the investors and contributors.
4. Smart Contracts:
There are various ways in which smart contracts enabled by blockchain technology can
establish more accountability when it comes to crowd funding. First and foremost, the
smart contracts would create obstacles that would hinder the funds from being released
without derivation with regards to a project or any other legitimate campaign.
Therefore, this would in turn prevent huge sums of money from being embezzled by
those who have a malafide intention or persons who are not eligible to run the campaign
in the first place. It is self-executing and by default transfers the amount of capital for
further development if all the criterion are met.
